# SYBA
SYnthetic BAyesian classifier (SYBA) is a Python package for the classification of organic compounds as easy-to-synthesize (ES) or hard-to-synthesize (HS). SYBA is a fragment-based method. The molecule is decomposed into ECFP4-like fragments, a fragment score is assigned to each fragment and all fragment scores are summed up to give the resulting SYBA score. If SYBA score is positive, the molecule is considered to be ES, otherwise it is considered to be HS. Fragment scores are the part of the SYBA algorithm and they were obtained by the analysis of the frequency of fragments in the databases of ES and HS compounds. ES compounds were obtained by a random selection from the [ZINC15](http://zinc.docking.org/) database, HS compounds were generated by the [Nonpher](https://github.com/lich-uct/nonpher) approach. More details can be found in [SYBA](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-020-00439-2) and [Nonpher](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13321-017-0206-2) papers.

## SYBA workflow
SYBA training (i.e., SYBA fragment score calculation) is demonstrated in the Jupyter notebook `modules/syba/docs/notebooks/prepare_fragment_counts.ipynb`. The example of SYBA, as well as SAScore, SCScore and Random forest, classification for a new compound is available in `modules/syba/docs/notebooks/prepare_results.ipynb`. Jupyter notebook can be installed from Conda with the command `conda install jupyter`.
