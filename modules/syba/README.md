# SYBA
SYnthetic BAyesian classifier (SYBA) is a Python package for the classification of organic compounds as easy-to-synthesize (ES) or hard-to-synthesize (HS). SYBA is a fragment-based method. The molecule is decomposed into ECFP4-like fragments, a fragment score is assigned to each fragment and all fragment scores are summed up to give the resulting SYBA score. If SYBA score is positive, the molecule is considered to be ES, otherwise it is considered to be HS. Fragment scores are the part of the SYBA algorithm and they were obtained by the analysis of the frequency of fragments in the databases of ES and HS compounds. ES compounds were obtained by a random selection from the [ZINC15](http://zinc.docking.org/) database, HS compounds were generated by the [Nonpher](https://github.com/lich-uct/nonpher) approach. More details can be found in [SYBA](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-020-00439-2) and [Nonpher](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13321-017-0206-2) papers.

## Instalation

[RDKit](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit) (recommended version >=2018-03-1)

### Installation with Anaconda
SYBA is distributed as a Conda package. Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system that makes setting up a development environment for any project very easy. To install Conda package, you have to get either full [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution or its lightweight variant, [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). SYBA is installed from Anaconda/Miniconda by running the following command from the Linux terminal:
```bash
conda install lich::syba
```

## Quick start
SYBA input is a CSV file consisting of the following columns: CMPND_ID,SMILES,OTHER_COLUMNS. OTHER_COLUMNS can contain any additional data and these columns are skipped. Output is a CSV file in the format CMPND_ID,SMILES,SYBA_SCORE. Negative SYBA scores indicate hard-to-synthesize compounds, while positive scores indicate easy-to-synthesize compounds.

## Usage

### Terminal
SYBA is automatically installs a command line tool `syba`.

```bash
$ syba [INPUT_FILE [OUTPUT_FILE]]
```

### In Python scripts
```python
from rdkit import Chem
from syba.syba import SybaClassifier

syba = SybaClassifier()
syba.fitDefaultScore()
smi = "O=C(C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O"
syba.predict(smi)
# syba works also with RDKit RDMol objects
mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi)
syba.predict(mol=mol)
# syba.predict is actually method with two keyword parameters "smi" and "mol", if both provided score is calculated for compound defined in "smi" parameter has the priority
syba.predict(smi=smi, mol=mol)
```

## SYBA workflow
SYBA training (i.e., SYBA fragment score calculation) is demonstrated in Jupyter notebook accessible in `docs/notebooks/prepare_fragment_counts.ipynb`. The example of SYBA, as well as SAScore, SCScore and Random forest, classification for a new compound is available in `docs/notebooks/prepare_results.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebook can be installed from Conda with the command `conda install jupyter`.
