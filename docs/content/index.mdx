# HEDGEHOG

**Hierarchical Evaluation of Drug GEnerators tHrOugh riGorous filtration**

HEDGEHOG is a comprehensive benchmark pipeline for evaluating generative models in molecular design. It takes a set of generated SMILES strings and progressively filters them through physicochemical descriptors, structural alerts, synthetic accessibility checks, molecular docking, and post-docking pose analysis — producing a detailed HTML report with per-stage statistics, interactive visualizations, and generative quality metrics.

## Key Features

- **7-stage evaluation pipeline** — molecules pass through Mol Prep (Datamol standardization), descriptors, structural filters, synthesis evaluation, docking, docking filters, and final descriptor recalculation.
- **11 structural filters** — common alerts (PAINS, Glaxo, BMS, Dundee), molecular graph severity, molecular complexity, NIBR, Bredt rule, Lilly MedChem rules, plus 5 medicinal chemistry filters (protecting groups, ring infraction, stereo center, halogenicity, symmetry).
- **Retrosynthesis analysis** — synthetic accessibility scoring with SA Score, SYBA, and full retrosynthetic route analysis via AiZynthFinder.
- **Molecular docking** — binding affinity scoring and pose generation with SMINA and/or GNINA, followed by pose quality filtering.
- **Automated reporting** — interactive HTML report with molecule retention funnel, descriptor distributions (with reference threshold lines), filter breakdowns, docking results, and MolEval generative metrics.
- **CLI and TUI interfaces** — a Typer-based command-line interface (`hedgehog` / `hedge`) for scripted workflows, plus an interactive terminal UI built with Node.js for visual configuration and pipeline management.

## Quick Example

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LigandPro/hedgehog.git
cd hedgehog

# Install AiZynthFinder (required for synthesis stage)
./modules/install_aizynthfinder.sh

# Install the package
uv sync

# Run the full pipeline on test data
uv run hedgehog run
```
