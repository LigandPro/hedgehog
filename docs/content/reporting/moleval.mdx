# MolEval Metrics

HEDGEHOG includes a vendored copy of [MolEval](https://github.com/MolScore/MolScore) (from MolScore
v1.9.5, MIT license) to compute intrinsic distribution quality metrics at multiple pipeline stages.
These metrics evaluate the **diversity and intrinsic quality** of molecule sets without
requiring a reference dataset.

## Active Metrics

Nine metrics are enabled by default. Validity and Uniqueness are disabled because they are always
1.0 after RDKit parsing and deduplication. MCE-18 is computed separately and reported alongside the
intrinsic MolEval metrics.

| Metric | What It Measures | Range | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------------|-------|----------------|
| **IntDiv1** | Internal diversity (1 - mean pairwise Tanimoto similarity) | 0--1 | Higher = more diverse set. Values near 1.0 mean molecules are structurally dissimilar. |
| **IntDiv2** | Internal diversity squared (IntDiv1^2) | 0--1 | Amplifies differences at high diversity. More sensitive to clustering. |
| **SEDiv** | Sphere exclusion diversity -- fraction of chemical space "covered" by the set | 0--1 | Higher = better coverage of Tanimoto space. Measures how well the set fills diversity spheres. |
| **ScaffDiv** | Scaffold diversity -- ratio of unique Murcko scaffolds to total molecules | 0--1 | Higher = more structurally distinct core scaffolds. Low values indicate scaffold redundancy. |
| **ScaffUniqueness** | Fraction of scaffolds that appear only once | 0--1 | Higher = each scaffold is represented by a single molecule. Low = scaffold over-representation. |
| **FG** | Functional group diversity ratio | 0--1 | Higher = wider variety of functional groups across the set. |
| **RS** | Ring system diversity ratio | 0--1 | Higher = more varied ring systems. Low values suggest reliance on a few ring types. |
| **Filters** | Fraction passing medicinal chemistry filters (MCF + PAINS) | 0--1 | Higher = cleaner set. Molecules failing PAINS or MCF contain known promiscuous substructures. |
| **MCE18** | Mean MCE-18 molecular complexity | 0--∞ | Higher = more complex structures (reported as an average over molecules). |

## Pipeline Checkpoints

Metrics are computed at five stages to track how chemical diversity evolves through the filtering
pipeline:

| Checkpoint | Source File | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Input** | `input/sampled_molecules.csv` | Raw generated molecules before any filtering |
| **Descriptors** | `stages/01_descriptors_initial/filtered/filtered_molecules.csv` | After descriptor calculation and initial property filtering |
| **StructFilters** | `stages/03_structural_filters_post/filtered_molecules.csv` | After all structural filters (PAINS, NIBR, Lilly, medchem, etc.) |
| **Synthesis** | `stages/04_synthesis/filtered_molecules.csv` | After retrosynthesis feasibility filtering |
| **DockingFilters** | `stages/06_docking_filters/filtered_molecules.csv` | After docking score threshold filtering |

The expected trend is:

- **Diversity metrics** (IntDiv, SEDiv, ScaffDiv) may decrease as aggressive filtering removes
  outliers, or may increase if redundant molecules are removed.
- **Filters metric** should increase across stages as problematic substructures are eliminated.
- **ScaffUniqueness** typically increases as duplicate scaffolds are filtered out.

## Configuration

MolEval metrics are configured via `config_moleval.yml`, referenced from the main pipeline config:

```yaml
# config_moleval.yml
run: true
n_jobs: 4
device: cpu            # cpu or cuda:0
max_molecules: 2000    # subsample for O(N^2) metrics

# Metric groups (toggle individual metric families)
validity: false          # Always 1.0 after RDKit parsing
uniqueness: false        # Always 1.0 after dedup
internal_diversity: true # IntDiv1, IntDiv2
se_diversity: true       # Sphere exclusion diversity
scaffold_diversity: true # ScaffDiv, ScaffUniqueness
functional_groups: true  # FG diversity ratio
ring_systems: true       # RS diversity ratio
filters: true            # MCF + PAINS passage rate
mce18: true              # Mean MCE-18 molecular complexity
```

### Key Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `run` | bool | `true` | Enable/disable all MolEval metrics |
| `n_jobs` | int | `4` | Parallel workers for metric computation |
| `device` | str | `cpu` | Compute device (`cpu` or `cuda:0`) |
| `max_molecules` | int | `2000` | Subsample threshold for O(N^2) pairwise metrics |
| `seed` | int | `42` | Random seed for deterministic subsampling |
| `mce18` | bool | `true` | Enable mean MCE-18 molecular complexity reporting |

## Deterministic Computation

The intrinsic metric computation uses a `seed` parameter and a local `random.Random(seed)` instance
for subsampling. This ensures:

- **Reproducible results** across runs with the same input data.
- **Thread safety** -- no global random state is mutated.
- The default seed is `42`, configurable via the `seed` key in `config_moleval.yml`.

## Output

MolEval results appear in three places:

1. **HTML report** -- line chart and heatmap in dedicated sections.
2. **`RUN_INFO.md`** -- a Markdown table appended to the run info file with per-stage metric values.
3. **`report_data.json`** -- raw metric data under the `moleval` key.
